# Smart Fridge

Smart Fridge is an fridge inventory manager app which stores information of all items in your fridge and reminds the user if any item is about to expire.
There are two ways of making an entry into the Fridge. You can do it either by Real-time Object detecion or manual entry.

The objective of this app is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. I'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. Other Firebase features such as Storage and Cloud Notifications are also integrated in the app to add features such as image uploading and scheduling app notifications
